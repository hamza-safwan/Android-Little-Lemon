I am a research scientist working at [Google Research](https://research.google/).
My present research interests include: LLMs and Transformer models, meta-learning, computer vision, generative models, compression of Deep Neural Networks, semi-supervised learning and information theory.

Prior to this, in between 2012 and 2015, I held a postdoc position at [UC Berkeley Physics Department](https://physics.berkeley.edu/) working in [Prof. Wurtele's group](https://plasma.physics.berkeley.edu/).
My research revolved around numerical studies of antihydrogen formation and trapping.

I earned my PhD from Princeton University in 2011 under the supervision of [Prof. Nathaniel Fisch](https://plasma.princeton.edu/people/nathaniel-j-fisch) and in close collaboration with [Dr. Ilya Dodin](https://theory.pppl.gov/people/profile.php?pid=21&n=Ilya-Dodin) and [Prof. Gennady Fraiman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TVOmrb4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
There I worked on alpha-channeling in mirror machines, wave propagation in plasmas and laser-plasma interaction.
